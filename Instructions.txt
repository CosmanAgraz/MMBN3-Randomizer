[INTRO]
This randomizer can be used for either version of Mega Man Battle Network 3. Credit goes to the Samfin, Prof.9, and Rockman.exe, as well as credit from myself for making quite a few of the following files and allowing tweaking of their settings.

[Usage Instructions]
1) Obtain a clean rom of MMBN3 Blue or MMBN3 White.

2) Put the rom inside the same folder as the "MMBN3 Randomizer.exe" (for convenience's sake).

--OPTIONAL: Patch the rom with an IPS patcher, using one of the Open Mode patches. This will allow
access to most of the game's areas from the get-go.

3) Run "MMBN3 Randomizer.exe".

4) Give a value to every setting. Once you're done with everything, hit the "Randomize!" button.

5) Once the program says it's "Done!", close it. You should now see a file named similarly to the "Output File" setting.
This is your randomized rom! Open it with an emulator of your choice.

[Randomizer Modifiers]
The program comes with many options. Here's a short description of each option and what they do.

"Power Multiplier" is for Battle Chips and Program Advances. (0.25 to 3.0)
"Power Variance" is also for Battle Chips and Program Advances. (0.0 to 0.9)
"Virus HP Multiplier" is for virus HP. (0.25 to 3.0)
"Virus HP Variance" is also for virus HP. (0.0 to 0.9)
"Chip Code Roullete Mode" is for the Chip Codes.
	0) Normal Codes
	1) All Stars
	2) Simplified
	3) Random
"NaviCust Program Shapes" can be randomized by setting this option to 1. Note that this is not recommended.
"Battlefield Stages" can be set to 0-2. 0 is default, 1 is randomized stage data, 2 is both stage data and IDs. Note that this is not recommended.
"Element Mode" can randomize the Elements with the following options:
	0) No Randomization
	1) Randomize Virus/Navi elementst (Always select an element)
	2) Randomize Chip elements (Might choose netural)
	3) Randomize both with the above settings.
"Randomize Navis" can be 0 or 1, set to 1 to enable.
"Skip Tutorial" can be 0 or 1, set to 1 to prevent the tutorial enemies from being randomized.
"Fill Shops" can be 0 or 1, set to 1 to fill every shop's contents with new Battle Chips.
"Folder Lock Mode" can be 0-2, and each setting had different rules.
	0) Disable Folder Lock Mode and randomize all folders.
	1) Single Folder Lock Mode, all folders in the game share the exact same chips and these are taken from
	the "folders_custom.txt".
	2) Multi Folder Lock Mode, similar to the above but instead of one folder, multiple folders are chosen.
	3) Single Random Folder Lock Mode, where the folder is randomly generated like normal but each folder is the same.
"Omega Mode" can be 0-3, with 0 being the default level of difficulty. Setting it above 0 forces all fights to be
a specific Virus level.
	0) Default Virus Levels
	1) Alpha+
	2) Beta+
	3) Omega
"Regular Memory Values" can be 0-99. To randomize RegMem Values, use a number between the range of 1 to 99.
"Hell Mode" can be 0-2. 0 is default. 1 disables the ability to increase your Maximum HP with HP Memories.
2 disables HP Memories completely, adding the disabling of Run Rate increases and gaining Current HP.
The "Seed" can be anything you want (or nothing for the current time)

Multiplier is applied first, then Variance. Multiplier straight up multiplies the value by the number specified in the line. Can be between 0.25 and 3. Variance multiplies again, but can work in both directions and is between 0.0 and 0.9.

[*_attackpower.txt]
These files are for Battle chips (chip_attackpower.txt) and Program Advances (pa_attackpower.txt).
Some values are forced to be zero, while others can be changed from their defaults.
MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE ALTERING.

[navi_data.txt]
Holds Navi offsets, names, and HP values.
DO NOT EDIT THE OFFSETS OR NAMES. HP is okay though.

[virus_data.txt]
Holds Virus' HP, Attack Power, and Name, in that order.
DO NOT EDIT THE NAMES. Also, Attack Power is unused due to being obscured in each Virus' AI.

[chip_data.txt, pa_data.txt, chip_names.txt, pa_names.txt]
The *_data.txt files might change the rank of chips and P.A.s, though I'm unsure if that has an effect in-game.
DO NOT EDIT THE NAME FILES.

[Seed Info]
If you see this file, you can share the info inside with others to generate similar randomized ROMs.
If you're using modifiers, they'll also be included for people to copy down for their run.
Note that if you export detailed seed info that this is also the game's spoiler log!

[chip_randomnames.txt]
Stores randomly chooseable chip names! Have fun making your own. Also, have at least 1 name for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 letter Chip Names. Otherwise you'll run into an infinite loop when using randomized names.

If you want to use special characters, such as Sigma or Omega, I've included a list of all applicable symbols and alphanumeric characters in a single text file.

[enemy_randomnames.txt]
Stores randomly chooseable Virus and Navi names! Have fun making your own. Please keep at least 1 name for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 letter Enemy Names.

[ncp_patterns.txt]
The randomizer reads this file to change the NaviCust Program Shapes. I made a program to easily add more Program Shapes to this list.

Each entry in this list is 2 patterns of 5x5 grids as one line, with every 5 0s and 1s counting as a single row. Each pattern is 25 tiles on the board, and each pattern has a "Compressed" pattern for the other 25 tiles. Be sure to include both.

[stages.txt]
The randomizer reads this file to chage the Battle Stage Panels.

Each line has a total of 24 numbers ranging from 0 to 10, but only 18 of the available numbers are used for the panels themselves. The other 6 "0"s are used to seperate the panels by row. This is how it works interally in the ROM:

00 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 00 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 00

?? Can be any number between 0x00 and 0x0A. Anything else and it'll glitch the panel out. I also don't recommend setting the panels to 1. Panel Types are listed below:

0: Empty Panel
1: Cracked Open Panel
2: Normal Panel
3: Cracked Closed Panel
4: Poison Panel
5: Metal Panel
6: Grass Panel
7: Ice Panel
8: Lava Panel
9: Holy Panel
10: Sand Panel

Please use the integer values provided and not hexidecimal, as that's how it's set up to be used inside of the randomizer itself.

[folders_custom.txt]
The randomizer reads this file and force-sets all Folders to one of the specific folder setups in this file. This is mainly used for Specific Folder runs.

Each line has a total of 30 Chips and Codes, with the Chips seperating each other by commas and the Codes are seperated from the Chips by spaces. Both values are integers (not the hexidecimal equivalent), and take up that particular slot in the Folder.

Codes go from 0 to 26, while Chips go from 1 to 312. I recommend following standard in-game Folder rules to prevent issues, and if you need a refresher, they're as followed:
1) Only up to 4 of the same Standard Chip.
2) Only 1 of the same Mega and Giga Chip.
3) Only up to 4 Mega Chips by default.
4) Only up to 1 Giga Chip by default.
5) Some Gigas and Megas are version-exclusive and should not be used at all as there's no failsafe for them.
